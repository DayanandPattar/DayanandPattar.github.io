    data-img-src="./assets/images/Thumbnails/middleware.png" 
    data-description="<p>This middleware solution bridged various social media platforms and PBX systems, including 3CX, with a custom CRM, delivering a unified communication experience and enhancing customer relationship management. By synchronizing data from multiple channels in real-time, it offered support teams immediate access to comprehensive interaction histories, streamlining customer service workflows.</p>

<p><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Centralized Communication Management:</strong> Created middleware to connect social platforms and PBX systems with the CRM, allowing all communications to be managed in one place.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Synchronization:</strong> Implemented data syncing across social channels, PBX, and CRM, ensuring all communication records were consistently updated.</li>
  <li><strong>3CX Integration for Advanced Call Handling:</strong> Tailored the middleware to work seamlessly with the 3CX PBX system, enabling call handling, call logging, and customer interaction management directly within the CRM.</li>
  <li><strong>API Development for Data Exchange:</strong> Built robust APIs to facilitate secure communication between the middleware, CRM, and external platforms, optimizing for both performance and security.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Handling Diverse API Protocols and Data Formats:</strong> Integrating multiple platforms with unique API protocols posed compatibility issues.<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Designed a modular API handling layer that standardized data formats across platforms, converting incoming data into a CRM-compatible structure. Integrated rate-limiting controls to manage platform restrictions effectively, ensuring steady performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Ensuring Real-Time Synchronization:</strong> Maintaining up-to-date data flow between systems required low-latency real-time syncing for consistent user experience.<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Utilized asynchronous programming and message queues to achieve efficient, non-blocking data synchronization. This approach minimized latency and handled high volumes of interactions without bottlenecks.</li>
  <li><strong>Managing High Data Traffic from 3CX Integration:</strong> The continuous data stream from voice and message logs in the PBX required efficient traffic management.<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented data buffering and batch processing to handle surges in traffic. Memory optimization techniques kept resource usage low while maintaining high-speed data processing.</li>
  <li><strong>Securing Sensitive Data Transmission:</strong> Handling sensitive customer information across channels demanded robust security measures.<br><strong>Solution:</strong> Enforced end-to-end encryption using TLS for all data transmissions, with secure token-based authentication for access. Integrated role-based access controls to restrict sensitive data to authorized users only.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> C++, Asynchronous Programming, Message Queues, 3CX Integration API, RESTful APIs, Data Encryption (TLS), Secure Access Controls</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong> The middleware transformed the CRM into a centralized hub for multi-channel customer interactions by providing real-time insights and a comprehensive view of customer communications. This streamlined approach improved service efficiency and customer satisfaction, empowering support teams to deliver faster, more informed responses.</p>
